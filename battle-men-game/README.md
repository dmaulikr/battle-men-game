*** This is a game that meets the basic requirements of the class that I am taking. Still left to do:

# Add sound effects and background music

# Make my code DRY (lots of room for improvement here)

# Allow user to choose a player

# Create a game state class

* I am honestly not really into games so I wanted to move on to something I found more interesting.
