# battle-men-game

This is a game that meets the basic requirements of the class that I am taking. Still left to do:

* Add sound effects and background music

* Make my code DRY (lots of room for improvement here)

* Allow user to choose a player

* Create a game state class

Honestly, I am not really very excited about creating games, so I wanted to move on to something I found a bit more interesting.
